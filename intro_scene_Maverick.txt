A geek will always geek: I finally managed to identify the carriers and some of the air units for the Top Gun Maverick (awesome!!) intro: aircraft carrier: USS Abraham Lincoln; aircraft: F/A-18E/F Super Hornet from VFA-151 "Vigilantes" and at least one Super Hornet from VFA-31 "Tomcatters" (off USS Gerald R Ford - found one legible name Lt Cdr James McMillan, currently the C/O of VFA-27, but he was with THREE ONE before, possibly with VFA-151 too), F-35C of VMFA-314 "Black Knights" (Marines) on USS Abraham Lincoln (the very first unit to deploy the F-35C onboard an aircraft carrier!).
