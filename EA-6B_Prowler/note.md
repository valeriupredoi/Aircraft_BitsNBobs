Service History Highlights

Built by Grumman as part of the later EA-6B production run (Block 89).

VAQ-141 “Shadowhawks” assignment:

Seen aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) in 1999 with Carrier Air Wing 8.

Tail code AJ, side number 500.

The 1999 cruise included Operation Allied Force (the NATO campaign over Yugoslavia/Kosovo). VAQ-141 flew combat support missions with the EA-6B, providing radar jamming and AGM-88 HARM support to suppress enemy air defenses.

After VAQ-141, the aircraft is also documented with VAQ-132 later in the 2000s (AA-500, “BUSTYA”), showing that it transferred squadrons during its service life.

Context: VAQ-141 in 1999

VAQ-141 deployed with CVW-8 aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt from March–September 1999.

During Operation Allied Force, VAQ-141 aircraft (including 161350) flew from the Adriatic Sea in support of NATO strikes. The squadron’s Prowlers played a crucial role in jamming Serbian radars and launching HARMs against surface-to-air missile sites.
