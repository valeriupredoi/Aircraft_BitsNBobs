## Missions stats

- Total group missions for 1944: 125
- Total group missions before 23 August 1944: 67
- Total group missions to Romania in 1944: 11
- Total group missions before 20 Jan 1945: 128
- (assumed) total missions for 42-52699: 55 + 1 = 56

## Probabilities

- Best case scenario: assume "Valiant Lady" arrived in theater at the start of 485th BG deployment (April 1944):
  - total number of missions to Romania for 485th BG: 11
  - minimum mission rate for "Valiant Lady": R = 56/128 = 0.44
  - minimum number of missions to Romania for "Valiant Lady": 0.44 x 11 = 4.81 == 5
- Later deployment for "Valiant Lady" (after April 1944, but before 23 August 1944):
  - minimum number of missions to Romania for "Valiant Lady": (11/128) x 56 - PLM = 4.81 - PLM
  - PLM: number of "missed" missions to Romania (before "Valiant Lady" arrives in theatre):
   - June:   1 x 0.44 = 0.44 so effective missions: 4.37 == 4
   - July:   5 x 0.44 = 2.20 so effective missions: 2.61 == 3
   - August: 9 x 0.44 = 3.96 so effective missions: 0.85 == 1
