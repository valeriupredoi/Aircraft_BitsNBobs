## Jesse Folmar's Corsair that shot down a MiG-15

I wanted to get the old Academy 1/48 Korean War Corsair (the latest boxing - 12353, with lovely Crossdelta decals), and I realized I can easily faff a bit with the Bureau Number (Bu.No.) of one of the options included in the kit, to get the correct markings for the Corsair piloted by Jesse Folmar. Yes, you can build Jesse Brown's or Tom Hudner's aircraft straight out the box, a touching story of Medal of Honor fame, and nicely told in the 2022 movie "Devotion", but I consider Folmar's story a bit more interesting from the combat aviation point of view - the guy shot down a MiG-15 in an epic dogfight! Here's the story for your historical, and reference consideration.

Jesse Gregory Folmar was a Marine Corps pilot during World War II and the Korean War. On 10 September 1952,
he became the first U.S. pilot of a propeller-driven aircraft to shoot down a jet-powered MiG-15. Folmer was awarded
the Silver Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions. He retired from the Marine Corps in 1959 with the rank
of major. By 1951, Jesse Folmar and the VMF-312 “Checkerboard” squadron were flying F4U-4B and F4U-5N
Corsairs. They were assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Sicily. Between August 1950 and September 1952, the Sicily
supported strikes into North Korea by F4U units VMF-214 and VMF-323. Capt Folmar’s VMA-312 operated from the ship
between 4 September and 19 October 1952. The ship and squadron served with the United Nations Escort and
Blockading Force and supported operations along the Taedong River in North Korea.
On 10 September 1952, a close air support mission was called for near Chinnampo. Folmar was leading one division, and
during the mission, he and his wingman, Lt Walter Daniels, would be involved in one of the most historic air missions of
the war. Taking off at 1610 hrs, they were ordered to attack a troop concentration on the south side of the Taedong
River. Although outclassed by the new generation of Communist jet fighters, the prop Corsairs were chiefly used in the
close air support role. In this case, the Navy and Marine Corps F4U-5N Corsairs night-fighters were sent up against the
night raiders that North Korea sortied over UN lines after dark. Capt Folmar recalled how events unfolded that night:

"As we crossed the coast and headed into enemy territory, we began executing a tactical weave at 10,000 ft. Arriving
over the target area, we observed no activity, so we continued to fly reconnaissance in the area of the Taejon estuary. As
we started to bank over a small island off the coast, I caught a glimpse of two MiG-15s in the early stages of setting up
for firing pass on us. They were in loose section formation, so I steepened the angle of my banking turn into them, while
at the same time increasing power. I jettisoned all external ordnance and fuel tanks and then switched to the guard
channel to report that we were being attacked by MiGs. I told Lt Daniels to fly a much tighter weave, and not to let the
communist out of his sight. Seconds later, I spotted two more of them closing rapidly from my ‘eight o’clock.’ I turned hard to the left, trying to bring my guns to bear before they could open fire, but due to their rapid closure, I was unable to
do so. Their tracers were overshooting us, so I reversed my bank to the right and turned inside one of the MiGs as he
started a climbing left turn. I pulled up and got him squarely in my gunsights, giving him about 20 mils’ lead. I then
triggered off a long five-second burst with my four 20 mm cannon."

Folmar became the first U.S. pilot of a prop aircraft to shoot down a jet-powered MiG-15. However, the victory was
short-lived as Folmar was almost immediately shot down by one of the remaining MiGs. Just as he pulled the D-ring on
his parachute, he heard an ear-splitting noise, and he looked up to see another MiG firing at his crippled Corsair. Seven
MiG-15s remained in the area, but they departed as soon as Folmar hit the water. He estimated that he was in the sea
for about eight minutes before being rescued by an SA-16 Albatross ‘Dumbo’.

Because of his exploits against Communist MiGs, Folmar consulted with military air experts. When John Boyd
established the “OOAP Loop” analysis of observe–orient–decide–act, Jesse Folmar's actions became one of the
cornerstones of the battle theory.
