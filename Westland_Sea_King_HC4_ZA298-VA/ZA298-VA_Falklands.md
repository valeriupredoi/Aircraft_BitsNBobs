ZA298-VA in the Falklands War (1982)
------------------------------------
(distilled from John Sheldon's excellent "Commando Helicopter Aircrewman", Air World, 2021)

- assigned to 846 Squadron aboard HMS Fearless (L10, amphibious assault ship, in service 1965-2002)
- May 25th: sinking of HMS Coventry D118 Type 42 destroyer; ZA298 was the first rescue helicopter at the scene; crew: Bill Fewtrell, Alf Tupper (DSM awarded on the day, for staying behind with the rescue dinghies), and John Sheldon (crew chief)
- dropped an unstable load of sweets and nutty bars, entire 846 sqn had the grid point for that "disaster", and they kept coming back to replenish
- late May: engine change, aboard RFA Fort Austin (in service 1979-2021)
- nearly crashed into the sea while returning to Fearless (night flight, no NVG)
- May 31st: crew goes on board HMS Fearless for hot food&showers - lucky move, since that night an Argentinian Canberra bombed their camp site, their tent being the only one destroyed!
- forward supplying Royal Marines Artillery battery, 29 Commando
- June 8th: assist with rescue from RFA Sir Galahad and RFA Sir Tristram troop landing ships at Bluff Cove, bombed by Argentinian A-4 Skyhawks and Mirages/Daggers; pilot on the day: Simon Thornewill, crew: Alf Tupper and John Sheldon, ZA298 was tasked with evacuation of the injured and burnt to the Ajax Bay field hospital ("Red Green Life Machine");
- that day the port door broke down, so it later got replaced with a Sea King HAS5 blue door - according to Sheldon, ZA298 flew the rest of the war with a blue port door!
- June 13th: evaded an attack from two pairs of Argentinian A-4 Skyhawks, near Teal Inlet; one 20mm shell pierced one blade; repaired on the spot, in some two hours; the section of blade is now at the Fleet Air Arm Museum - so is ZA298;
- June 15th: pick up General Menendez from San carlos racecourse, for the official surrender.
