## Focke Wulf 189A "Uhu" in Romanian service

The Focke-Wulf Fw-189A-1 photo reconnaissance and observation aircraft in service with the
Royal Romanian Air Force (RRoAF), and after 23 August 1944, the Romanian Air Force (RoAF): five such aircraft
were delivered to Romania in Galați in 1943 and assigned to the 8th Assault Group (Grupul 8 Asalt),
equipped with Henschel Hs-129B, active on the Kirovograd front (Ukraine). Photographic evidence
suggests that at least two Uhus were most definitely used by the RRoAF and RoAF. Other sources
cite a delivery of eleven Uhus to Romania.

In the battles on the Ukrainian front, it is not yet known whether the Romanian-operated Fw-189A-1
aircraft took part in actual combat actions (though there are mentions of their missions in various memoirs,
as well as its nickname in the Romanian Air Force is well known - "Codosul", meaning "the lazy one").
It is also quite possible those were German Uhus, from e.g. Nahaufklärungsgruppe 14
(<https://luftwaffedata.co.uk/index.php/Stab/NAGr._14>) that operated in close vicinity of Grupul 8 in
the Kramatorsk/Izyum area in late summer 1943. NAGr. 14 was also stationed in Romania, having beat
a hastily retreat to Hungary, after 23 August 1944 (when Romania changed sides to the Allies).

However, in the summer of 1944, back in Romania, night training on
the Fw-189A-1 for combat and photo reconnaissance-observation began in Arad, Oradea and Tecuci.
According to the same data extracted from the German publication "Luftwaffe Exports 1937-45"
published in 1968, it is also specified that Romania ordered two more Fw-189A-1 reconnaissance aircraft
during May 1944, but there is no exact data on whether the delivery was fulfilled. On the other hand,
surprisingly, in the Soviet publication "Soviet Luftwaffe Captures" edition 1961, it is specified that
after 23 August 1944, what Romania had as surviving Fw-189A aircraft, together with Fw-190A fighters, including
Henschel Hs-129B attack aircraft, were all confiscated by the Soviets as war reparations! The same Soviet
publication also states that Romania had no fewer than 22 Fw-190A fighter aircraft captured from the Germans,
but only 6 were airworthy and also confiscated by the Red Army, including those unairworthy, to be used as
spare parts. However, the Romanian Hs-129Bs were heavily used in operations in support of the Red Army
in Transylvania, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia in late 1944-1945, assigned to Grupul 8 Asalt, therefore it is
more than possible that the Fw-189As were also still in Romanian hands.

2) the only surviving Fw-189A-1 "White 2" ("Alb 2") at the ASAM Cotroceni airfield (ASAM stands for Administration of Aviation and Navy Establishments), which was hidden by Romania so as not to be confiscated by the Soviets.
