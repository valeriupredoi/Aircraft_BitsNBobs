## Focke Wulf 189A "Uhu" in Romanian service

The Focke-Wulf Fw-189A-1 Uhu photo reconnaissance and observation aircraft in service with the
Royal Romanian Air Force (RRoAF), andi, after 23 August 1944, the Romanian Air Force (RoAF):
five such aircraft were delivered to Romania in Galați in 1943 and assigned to the 8th Assault Group
(Grupul 8 Asalt), equipped with Henschel Hs-129B ground attackers, active on the Kirovograd front
(Ukraine). Photographic evidence suggests that at least two Uhus were most definitely used by the
RRoAF and RoAF. Other sources cite a delivery of eleven Uhus to Romania.

In the battles on the Ukrainian front, it is not yet known whether the Romanian-operated Fw-189A-1
aircraft took part in actual combat actions (though there are mentions of fighter escort missions in various memoirs,
as well as its nickname in the Romanian Air Force is well known - "Codosul", meaning "the lazy one" - though this
was also given to the German Uhus). It is also quite possible those were German Uhus, from e.g. Nahaufklärungsgruppe 14
(<https://luftwaffedata.co.uk/index.php/Stab/NAGr._14>) that operated in close vicinity of Romanian deployments in
the Kramatorsk-Izyum area in late summer 1943, then Dnepropetrovsk-Zaporozhye-Melitopol in the fall of 1943.
NAGr. 14 was also stationed in Romania, having beat a hastily retreat to Poland then Hungary,
after 23 August 1944 (when Romania changed sides to the Allies).

However, in the summer of 1944, back in Romania, night training on
the Fw-189A-1 for combat and photo reconnaissance-observation began in Arad, Oradea and Tecuci.
According to the same data extracted from the German publication "Luftwaffe Exports 1937-45"
published in 1968, it is also specified that Romania ordered two more Fw-189A-1 reconnaissance aircraft
during May 1944, but there is no exact data on whether the delivery was fulfilled. On the other hand,
surprisingly, in the Soviet publication "Soviet Luftwaffe Captures" edition 1961, it is specified that
after 23 August 1944, what Romania had as surviving Fw-189A aircraft, together with Fw-190A fighters, including
Henschel Hs-129B attack aircraft, were all confiscated by the Soviets as war reparations! The same Soviet
publication also states that Romania had no fewer than 22 Fw-190A fighter aircraft captured from the Germans,
but only 6 were airworthy and also confiscated by the Red Army, including those unairworthy, to be used as
spare parts. However, the Romanian Hs-129Bs were heavily used in operations in support of the Red Army
in Transylvania, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia in late 1944-1945, assigned to Grupul 8 Asalt, therefore it is
more than possible that the Fw-189As were also still in Romanian hands.

## Photos of Romanian FW-189A

The photos represent:
1) a Fw-189A-1 reconnaissance aircraft wearing Romanian roundels, but without a tail number, photographed after 23 August 1944. Possibly, it was captured from the German army. Photo archive: Constantin Bujor.
2) the only surviving Fw-189A-1 "White 2" ("Alb 2") at the ASAM Cotroceni airfield (ASAM stands for Administration of Aviation and Navy Establishments), which was hidden by Romania so as not to be confiscated by the Soviets. Photo archive: Doina Anca Rădoi - Dâmboianu, niece of the Fw-189 pilot, Tecșa Ion.

4) profile of how the plane looked after 23 August 1944 (possibly captured from the Germans) (Bogdan Patrascu)

## German-Romanian FW-189 Operations (Romanian fighter escorts)

- NachAufklarungsGruppe NAGr = close reconnaissance group.

During NAGr 14 operations in Ukraine in the summer and autumn of 1943, fighter escorts were also provided
by Royal Romanian Air Force (RRoAF) 7th and 9th Fighter Groups (see <http://www.worldwar2.ro/arr/g7vt.htm>
and <http://www.worldwar2.ro/arr/g9vt.htm> for references). The Romanian 7th Fighter Group moved to
Kirovograd, Ukraine in June 1943, commencing operations over Southern Ukraine. Starting then,
multiple German recce missions benefited from RRoAF fighter escorts; 7th Group received praise for this
task in a note from Fliegerkorps IV HQ (tasked with air operations over the Donets Basin and
along the Mius River front, between Stalino (now Donetsk, Ukraine) and Rostov (now Rostov-on-Don, Russia)).

On 27 July 1943, Cpt. Av. "Bâzu" Cantacuzino's "patrulă" (combat air patrol) was tasked with escorting a German
recce aircraft (an Fw-198A belonging to NAGr 14). Due to technical difficulties, only "Bâzu"’s airplane could
be fuelled in time for the rendez-vous with the German Uhu. When he eventually reached the rendez-vous point,
the German plane was already under attack by a Yak. There were another two Yaks which were protecting the attacker.
"Bazu" fired from afar, and the Soviets turned on him. After two minutes he managed to get behind the Soviet ace,
and shot him down, before the wingmen could intervene. They ran away after seeing what happened to their flight
leader, who it is believed to have been Nikolay F. Khimushin (11 kills). On his way back to the airfield, "Bâzu"
furher shot down a Pe-2 bomber.
