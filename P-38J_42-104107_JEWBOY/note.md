Lockheed P-38J 42-104107 49th FS, 14th FG: JEWBOY over Romania
--------------------------------------------------------------

On 15 April 1944 2nd Lt. Philip M. Goldstein gets assigned Lockheed P-38J-15-LO 42-104107 Lightning (Numbered black 47 with small 07 on nose, named “JEWBOY”), on the day of an escort mission to Bucharest (though Source 1 already lists Goldstein as the pilot of 42-104107 on 2 April 1944).

The 7 May 1944 bomber escort mission to Bucharest (15th Air Force's third consecutive bombing raid to Romania):
  - 75 Romanian and 64 German fighters counter 15th AF;
  - targets included Chitila, Grivita, Giulesti, Gara de Nord, also Bucharest city center; Romanian civilian casualties: 411 dead, and 920 wounded, largest number to date;
  - Romanian fighter units involved: 1st, 2nd, and 6th Fighter Groups (Grupul 1, 2 and 6 Vanatoare);
  - Goldstein claims one victory (Fiat G50 claimed - probably wrong designation, either IAR-80/81 or FW-190); US airmen claim 18 aerial victories, much more than the actual Romanian-German losses - Romanians had a few damaged IAR-80/81 and Germans lost one FW-190 (Richard Grafmueller);
  - Earvie T. Cloyd 2nd Lt. 0-750541 of 37th FS gets shot down and taken POW (friend of Goldstein, freed in September 1944, during Operation Reunion);

Goldstein completed his 50th and last mission on 28 June 1944, and was sent home on 9 July 1944. He finished the war with three victories: a Bf-109 downed on 25 May 1944 over Steyr, Austria, the so-claimed Fiat G50 shot down over Bucharest, Romania on 7 May, and a FW-190 shot down over Piacenza, Italy, on 25 May 1944.

On 31 July 1944, at the Group's base at Triolo, Italy, 42-104107 is destroyed by Kenneth R. Warren 2nd Lt. 0-763014, with no injury to pilot. That was a landing accident.
