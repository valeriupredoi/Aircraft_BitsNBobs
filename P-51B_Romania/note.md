June 6 1944 - Galati bombed by 483rd Bomb Group (Forts)

Captain Robert Barkey in P-51B-15-NA s/n 43-24857, part of 319th Fighter Squadron, 325th Fighter Group, left Lesina, Italy for Ukraine on 2nd June 1944; on 6th June 1944 him and the rest of the 325th are escorting a wave of 104 USAAF B-17G bombers over Galati, Romania (with 54 Mustangs as escort); the bombers had taken off from Poltava, Ukraine, part of Operation Frantic I. 14th (Airacobras), 31st, 32nd (Mustangs), and 82nd (Lightnings - also part of the Lightnings' Black Day raid of 10 June 1944, over Ploesti) Fighter Groups also took part in Frantic I, part of US 15th Air Force. Lt Av Ion Dobran of 48th Fighter Squadron, 9th Fighter Group, Royal Romanian Air Force (RRAF) shoots down 2nd Lt. Barrie Davies (P-51B "Bee", 317th FS, 325th FG), but, in turn, he himself is shot down by Capt. Barkey; Dobran survives the crash landing with minor injuries and gets back to flying in a short time!

Soon after getting my Mustang, numbered 24,  I gave it my mother’s nickname — Bee. After scoring my first victory over Ploesti, I added “Honey” to the name, because it proved it had a sting. With my crew chief’s help and over his objections, I painted garish red stripes from nose to tail down the side of the Mustang. They did not remain long. The next day, ordered came to remove all added decorations except names so that our P-51s looked the same. With the help again of my crew chief and to his great satisfaction, we used paint remover to take off the red stripes. The following day we took part in the first shuttle mission from Italy to the Soviet Union. This aircraft was his original P-51 left behind in Russia due to severe battle damage. The squadron callsign was Mayfair and Barries aircraft number was 24. The replacement (42-103519)  looked exactly the same but with the addition of Honey to the nose and less checkerboard pattern paint due to a shortage of yellow paint at the time. The original P-51  was hit only once—during the June 6, 1944, mission flown from the Ukraine. Flying P-51s, we escorted B-17s attacking Galatz, Rumania. The fourth member of our flight, which was led by Wayne Lowry, returned early. Bob Bass was third member. We met 16 enemy fighters, and a fine battle ensued. I outmanoeuvred a Bf 109 and had him in my sights ready to achieve my first victory when he suddenly dropped wheels and flaps. He seemed to stop. I overshot and found myself in front of the Bf 109 desperately trying to escape. The hunter had become the hunted.
As suddenly as it began, the fight was over. I searched the sky for other planes, finally finding my flight leader. I joined him, and we flew line abreast, with me on the right, toward our Russian base. By flying side by side, we could cover each other. Wayne saw a third plane approaching from our right rear. He believed it was Bob Bass rejoining us, until it began firing.
Barrie: The first round evidently hit my canopy, because I remember nothing from the explosion until I found myself flying alone at 23,000 feet. I was very, very cold. My shoes, wet with dew from walking through high grass to the plane in early morning, were frozen. My right wing tip was shredded. After landing, we found the tail was nearly shot off, all four propeller blades had been hit, and an unexploded cannon round was found in the fuel tank that sat behind the seat. The flight surgeon spent nearly an hour picking shell fragments from my head, shoulders, and thighs. Wayne shot down the Bf 109 that had clobbered me, and I received a Purple Heart.

On 6 June, the 9th Fighter Group flew for the first time against the Americans. Lt. av. Dobran was playing bridge with Mucenica, Senchea and Simionescu, when the alarm was given. They took off quickly and because of this rush, he ended up without a wingman. He saw the USAAF formation and then he realized that he was alone. Below him were four monoplanes and first thought they were Gustavs from 56th Fighter Squadron. When he got closer he recognized the Mustangs. They were flying like they were at a parade. Dobran dived and fired at the one on the right. Smoke started to come out of the airplane. The others dispersed. He went for the bombers, but he fired from distance, because the Mustangs were closing in. He plunged down and managed to shake off two of them after some aerobatics. But the one that remained shot him down. Apparently the Mustang he claimed as a probable, was flown by 2lt. Barrie Davis (6 kills), who managed to arrive with his badly damaged aircraft to Mirogorod in the Ukraine. The USAAF fighter pilot who shot Dobran down that day was 1lt. Wayne Lowry (11 kills).
