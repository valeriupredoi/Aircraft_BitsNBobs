Of course I ordered the "new" Tamiya 1/24 962C, as soon as it was available in the UK, and, even if this is the old mould from the '80s, initially released as a Tamtech (RC) chassis and body shell (with pre-glued windows and headlamp covers), it'll still make a fun model to build. I did, however, notice that Tamiya don't really say what race/series this particular 962C is from. This is chassis number 117 belonging to Brun Motorsport (a famous Swiss privateer, that had very close ties with the Porsche factory), and this one is from the 200km of Norisring race, of 1987, driven by the Argentinian Oscar Larrauri (former endurance and F1 driver) and the German Jochen Mass (an endurance legend, and midfield F1 driver, who sadly passed away last month). The 1987 200 Meilen von NÃ¼rnberg was the sixth round of the 1987 World Sports-Prototype Championship, known as the ADAC Norisring TrophÃ¤e, as well as the second round of the 1987 German Supercup, known as the Bilstein Cup. It took place at the Norisring temporary street circuit, West Germany on June 28, 1987. Brun placed second overall, after the two scheduled races, that weekend. Note that, just like with other Tamiya race car kits, they don't include decals for some sponsors (as far as I can see it's only Shell that's missing here). Though admittedly the decals are wonderful, being made by Cartograf! I'll try to build this one before the end of the month, it's a really simple build ðŸ™‚
