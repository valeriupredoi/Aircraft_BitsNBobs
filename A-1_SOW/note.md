A-1J 52-142029 "Sock It To 'Em"
-------------------------------

The 56th Special Operations Wing (SOW) was formed in March 1967 with its mission to assist US special and unconventional forces and US friendly foreign government military forces throughout Indochina. The 602nd Special Operations Squadron (SOS) was assigned to the 56th SOW to provide armed escort for (C)SAR operations, escort or armed reconnaissance. They also provided escort for helicopters inserting or extracting Special Operations personnel from Laos, North Vietnam, and even illegal missions into Burma (now Myanmar). For three years the 602nd used TT as their tail letters and the call sign Firefly (night CAS and interdiction), Smoke (smoke marking, directed by FACs) or Sandy (escort to CSAR - combat search and rescue), depending on the mission.

A-1J BuNo 52-142029 - first built and delivered as an AD-7 for the US Navy, it carried the build number 142029. Like many Skyraiders, it served amongst many units, used with VA-216 (as ND-402) from 1957 (or even earlier) until 1962, it was then attributed to VA-122 as NJ-225 and later to VA-25. In 1966 the aircraft could be found at NAS Kisarazu, from where it was put into storage at AMARC, ‘the boneyard’. Here it was struck off charge on the 8th of August 1967 and transferred to the USAF as 52-142029 (52 referring to the budegt year the aircraft was commissioned). By July 1968, the aircraft had been refurbished at McClelland AFB in California and transferred via Cam Ranh Bay to Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base (NKP), ready to be assigned to the USAF 56th SOW, 602nd SOS. It was here where it received its ‘Sock it to ’em’ nickname and nose art. The aircraft was assigned to George Marrett (pilot) and Joe Toback (crew chief), as they both had been long enough in Southeast Asia to receive a personal aircraft. George decided to call the aircraft ‘Sock it to ’em’, after the popular 1960s NBC TV show, Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-In. A one off show that had proved popular that it became a series which ran for 140 episodes from January 22, 1968, to March 12, 1973. It remained their personal aircraft until both service members returned back to the US.

Sadly however, the aircraft was less fortunate. Less than three weeks after Joe and George had left, the aircraft was shot down by ground fire on the 26th of April 1969 near the Plain of Jars in the Xiangkhoang Province of Loas, with its pilot J. B. East KiA. George went on to become a test pilot for the Hughes Aircraft Company and author of various aviation books and articles. In his book, Cheating Death, he wrote about his time as a “Sandy’ rescue pilot at Udorn and Nakhon Phanom bases, among which his time with his personal aircraft. In total he completed 188 combat missions with over 600 combat hours and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross with two Oak Leaf Clusters and the Air Medal with eight Oak Leaf Clusters. He was also awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal for several flight tests with experimental aircraft at Edwards AFB. Over the decades, Joe and George had lost touch with each other. But 41 years after leaving Vietnam, they had found each other again via the internet and met for a flight in George’s 1945 Stinson L-5E Sentinel nicknamed, you guessed it, “Sock-it-to-Em.”
