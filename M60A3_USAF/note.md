## M60A3 in USAF: EOD

During Operation Desert Storm in the Gulf War of 1991, at least one US Air Force unit was equipped with M60 tanks. The 401st TFW (P - Provisional), deployed to Doha, Qatar had two M60A3 tanks fitted with M9 dozer blades, for use by explosives ordnance disposal personnel (EOD). It was planned that using the tanks would allow the EOD crews to remove unexploded ordnance from tarmac runway and taxiway surfaces with increased safety. The two tanks were "King Kong" and "Godzilla".
