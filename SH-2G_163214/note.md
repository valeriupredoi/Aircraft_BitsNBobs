Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Light 94 (HSL-94) — the “Titans” — was a U.S. Navy Reserve squadron based at NAS Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, and later at NAS Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove. Because it was a reserve Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS I) squadron, it typically didn’t deploy as a full unit aboard one ship. Instead, it provided detachments (Det) to various surface combatants — primarily Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates (FFGs) and Spruance-class destroyers (DDs) — in support of Atlantic Fleet operations.
