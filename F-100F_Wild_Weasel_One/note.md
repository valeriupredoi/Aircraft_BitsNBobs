### F-100F Wild Weasel One

The Air Force placed great hope on the success of the Wild Weasel concept. Project Wild Weasel used modified two-seat F-100Fs, with the pilot flying and firing weapons from the front seat, while an electronic warfare officer (EWO) tracked enemy radar systems in the back seat. These trailblazers created, tested and proved SAM suppression tactics in combat.

In November 1965 the first Wild Weasel crews deployed to Southeast Asia -- only four months after the first USAF SA-2 loss in Southeast Asia. Their four F-100Fs had been hastily modified under great secrecy with equipment that detected enemy radar sites. Reflecting the urgent need, these volunteers planned to finish their training in combat over North Vietnam, and they flew their first anti-SAM mission on December 1st, 1965. The SEA deployment was the second phase of a test program for the Radar Homing and Warning Equipment (RHAW) equipment. The first phase had started at Eglin under TAC Test 65-85 and was completed on 19 November 1965. "The primary objective of this evaluation was to determine, in a combat environment, the overall effectiveness of F-100F aircraft, equipped with special Radar Homing and Warning Equipment, to detect locate and, in conjunction with strike aircraft, destroy SA-2 installations. This first group was replaced in February 1966 by a second group that received three more modified F-100Fs.

Typically, one F-100F Wild Weasel crew hunted enemy SAM radars with electronic equipment. After pinpointing them visually, they attacked the radars with rockets. Accompanying F-105s then followed with bombs or rockets.

December 1st, 1965 - first mission: the first F-100F Wild Weasel mission escorting F-105s was flown from Korat RTAFB, Thailand. Maj Gary Willard and EWO Capt Walt Lifsey, in F-100F 58-1231, and Capt Edward B. White with EWO Capt Edward "Sandy" Sandelius, in a second F-100F led F-105s on the Wild Weasel's first IRON HAND mission of the Vietnam war.
"... Each led a flight of F-105s to 'troll' past a missile site to provoke it into action. For the attack on any site found, each Super Sabre carried two pods of 2.75-in unguided rockets. The F-105Ds carried various armament loads. The mission failed to stir any response from the SA-2 sites, however, as did similar missions in the weeks to follow." - "Wild Weasel - The SAM Suppression Story" by Larry Davis & "History of U.S. Electronic Warfare, Vol III"

The pioneer Wild Weasels proved the concept and developed effective tactics, destroying nine SA-2 sites and suppressing enemy SAMs for strike forces. Even so, three of the seven F-100Fs were lost (two in combat). The more powerful F-105F Wild Weasel III replaced Wild Weasel I F-100Fs in the summer of 1966 (there was no production Wild Weasel II).

The first Wild Weasel squadron was the 354th Tactical Fighter Squadron (TFS), part of the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing of the United States Air Force (USAF). From Takhli RTAFB, the 354th TFS flew some of the first Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions in history â€” locating and attacking North Vietnamese radar and missile sites to clear the way for U.S. bombing raids. After initial combat evaluation with the F-100F, later Wild Weasel units transitioned to the faster F-105F/G Thunderchief, which carried heavier loads and more advanced radar-homing systems, continuing operations from both Takhli and Korat RTAFB in Thailand.

### F-100F 58-1221 and 58-1226

On 25-Nov-65 the first four Wild Weasel I F-100Fs arrived at Korat RTAFB, Thailand. The planes had left Eglin
AFB, Florida, on 20 November 1965, where they had been training since 11 October 1965. The tail numbers of the four F-100Fs were: 58-1221, 58-1226, 58-1227, 58-1231. On the ferry flight, 58-1221 was crewed by Maj Garry A. Willard, Jr. the deployment commander, with pilot Capt Maurice G. Fricke in the rear cockpit.

Elctronic equipment: each aircraft had a radar homing and warning (RHAW) system, a panoramic Scan Receiver (IR-133), and a missile guidance warning receiver (WR-300) that were controlled by an electronic warfare officer in the rear cockpit. The front cockpit had a duplicate scope of the RHAW for the pilot.

On December 3, 1965, the F-100F Wild Weasels flew their third hunter-killer mission (the first two weather aborted). This was the first one to fly into North Vietnam and was flown with a flight of F-105s from the 469 TFS. Maj Garry A. Willard and EWO Capt Truman Walter Lifsey were in F-100F 58-1226. The Wild Weasel flight failed to rouse an SA-2 site in North Vietnam and so they "... experimented with some tactics and coordination between the Weasel birds and the strike flight, then hit a military barracks area southwest of Son La, about 15 nm north of the Laos border [at coordinates 21-09N and 104-09E]."

On December 4, 1965, the F-100F Wild Weasels flew their fifth hunter-killer mission with a flight of four F-105s from the 469 TFS. Capt Edward B. White and EWO Capt Edward "Sandy" Sandelius were in F-100F 58-1221. Flying as an airborne spare in F-100F 58-1226 were Wild Weasels Capt George H. Kerr with EWO Capt Donald J. Madden. Then, on December 22, "Aspen" flight from the 469 TFS, 6234 TFW, took off from Korat at 14:00 and refueled from KC-135 "White Anchor 21" at 14:30 at 20,000 feet. The four F-105Ds escorted an F-100F Wild Weasel on an Iron Hand Strike mission. Their time over target was 15:10, 58-1221 was crewed by Capt Edward B. White and EWO Capt Edward "Sandy" Sandelius. The Wild Weasel crew from "Aspen" flight did not find a SAM site. However, the F-100F Wild Weasel crew from another flight ("Spruce") escorted by four F-105D pilots from the 421 TFS found and destroyed a SAM site, the first (and only) success for the Wild Weasel I detachment that had arrived at Korat from Eglin on 25 November 1965 (see full mission log at <https://keithferrisart.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/F-100F-Wild-Weasel-History.pdf>).

On December 22, 1965, at 12:41 p.m., an F-100F Wild Weasel led four F-105s in destroying their first SAM site in North Vietnam. Capt Al Lamb and EWO Capt John E. "Jack" Donovan, in F-100F 58-1226, call sign "Spruce 05", led four F-105Ds from Korat RTAFB, Thailand, in an attack on a SAM site near the rail yard at Yen Bai. The five aircraft destroyed the SAM site with rockets and 20-mm gunfire. For leading the mission, the F-100F crew was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The four F-105D pilots of "Spruce" flight from the 421 TFS were Capt Donald E. Langwell, lead; Capt Van F. Heywood, #2; Capt Robert Edward "Bob" Bush, #3; and Capt Arthur L. Brattkus, #4.

On March 13, 1966, Wild Weasel F-100F 58-1221 crashed when its engine failed during a training flight from Korat.
The crew ejected successfully. The crew was Maj. Marion J. Tuttle and EWO Capt. Donald E. Clark, Jr. from the Wild Weasel I Detachment of the 6234 TFW. The aircraft crashed in an unpopulated area approximately 30 miles southeast of Ubon RTAB, Thailand, and was totally destroyed on impact. The cause was deemed to be compressor stall.
