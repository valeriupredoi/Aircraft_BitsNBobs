Hawker Tempest Mk V Series 2 NV994
----------------------------------

F/Lt Pierre Clostermann, No. 3 Squadron, No. 122 Wing. B. 112 Hopsten, Germany, April-June 1945

The first of F/Lt Pierre Clostermann's famous No. 3 Squadron Tempests, JF-E NV994, collected from No. 83 Group Support Unit, RAF Dunsfold around 15 April 1945, while No. 3 Sqn were at the Armament Practice Camp, RAF Warmwell. After a ten day break from operations to practice their gunnery technique and practice bombing, the squadron flew to a new base in Germany, B.112 Hopsten, on April 18, 1945. No 3. Squadron would not get the chance to try its bombing skills on operations before the end of the war-less than three weeks away. Clostermann shot down two Focke Wuld Fw 190D-9s on April 20 1945, over Dummer Lake, with Clostermann himself being shot up by Flak, and injured; his injuries kept him from flying until May 3, 1945. At 19:36 Clostemann took off from Rheine-Hopsten with another two Tempests, flown by MacIntyre and Gordon. An hour later they spotted a formation of Fw-190s that was attacking Allied forces below. In the ensuing battle Closterman managed to down two Dora-9s. The first one crashed in a ball of fire, and the second one, "White 1" belly landed near Dummer Lake in a water logged field where the "plane threw up a broom of mud" according to Clostermann. Therafter Clostermann saw the German pilot limp away from his damaged plane, trailing on his parachute. It was later reported that this German pilot succumbed to his wounds a few hours in an ambulance, perhaps one of the five pilots that IV./JG 51 lost during the final battles. Finally Clostermann managed to land his badly damaged Tempest and was glad to find that his pilot friend Gordon was still alive, after also being hit, and also somehow managing to limp back to base with his shot up Tempest. Photos taken on April 18, 1945 show that NV994 was not marked with Clostermann's scoreboard nor the name "Le Grand Charles" at that time; historical research indicates the name and the scoreboard markings (kills tally) were added after the war, around June 1945. On 1 July 1945, while attempting to land (after a large display of Air Force aircraft in Denmark), NV994 was damaged in an accident during a poor landing at Vaerlöse. It was declared Category B (needing repair) and returned to the UK. Following the damage to NV994, Clostermann was re-equipped with another Tempest Mk V — serial NV724, which took over the JF-E code. NV724 then continued in No. 3 Squadron service into late 1945 and also eventually received postwar personal markings (badge and optional Cross of Lorraine).
