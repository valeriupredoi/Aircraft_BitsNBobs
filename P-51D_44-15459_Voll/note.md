Missions over Romania
---------------------

23 June 1944 - Ploiesti, Romania
================================

450 US bombers take off with targets: Ploiesti - Societatea Romano-Americana and Dacia refineries (B-17 Flying Fortresses), and Giurgiu - harbour and oil pipeline installations (B-24 Liberators of multiple groups, including 485th BG). Results were mixed due to poor visibility. Ten USAAF bombers lost over both Ploiesti and Giurgiu. Romanian defenders were 1st, 6th, 7th, and 9th Figyhter Groups, that had to face a USAAF advance party made up of Mustangs, meant to strafe and saw chaos among the Royal Romanian Air Force. 1st Fighter Group lost their commander, Capt. Cdr. Ioan Sandu, shot down by USAAF north of Bucharest (pilot and wreck - IAR-80 serial 170 - found at Stefanesti, Jud. Ilfov). 7th Fighter Group also lost their commander, Capt. Av. Virgil Trandafirescu (Bf-109G), he led 11 Bf-109s off Boteni airfield, with heavy USAAF contact just north of Bucharest; Capt. Trandafirescu being shot down over Magurele, Jud. Ilfov. 31st FG claimed eight victories, one for Voll - his first victory. Possible IAR-80/81 or FW-190F, reference [1] says: "The Fw 190F of 4./SG 2 and II./SG 10 took the hardest punishment. 4./SG 10 lost three pilots (including the Staffelkapitän and ground-attack veteran, Knights Cross holder Hauptmann Günther Müller, who was killed in the Fw 190 F-8 white 13 on his 900th combat sortie). 4./SG 10 recorded four Fw 190 F-8 shot down with two pilots killed and one wounded. 31FG Lt. John J. Voll, who eventually would become the top scorer in the Fifteenth Air Force, scored his first victory (of 21 by the end of the war) with one of these Fw 190s, Rupert Weninger was shot down and killed by Mustangs on 24 June; four days later, Erich Gehring and Willi Dreyer were shot down and wounded.)" - though, from reference [2] (Luftwaffe records) we know II./SG 10 (moved to Bobruisk on 23 June 1944, though Hauptmann Muller of 4./SG 2 was indeed shot down over Ploiesti, and buried in Bucharest [3].
