On 28 June, the 1st Fighter Group scrambled its 17 IARs and intercepted a bomber formation and attacked it, while trying to avoid the Mustangs. Three B-17s were shot down. Also, adj. av. Zisu Sava claimed a P-51, which remained probable. This is the only case when a IAR-80 pilot claimed a Mustang. The group lost cpt. av. Stefanescu and adj. av. Prasinopol was wounded. This was the last battle with USAAF. A part of the 1st Fighter Group's pilots and airplanes were assigned to the 6th Fighter Group. At the end of July, the group started to train in order to convert to the Bf-109G.

In June 1944, the 9th Fighter Group flew 232 sorties and scored 10 victories. In the dogfights with the much superior (in numbers and performance of their airplanes) USAAF, the group lost adj. Constantin Lungulescu (12 victories) and lt. Teodor Greceanu (20 victories) and adj. Dumitru Encioiu (5 victories) were wounded.

Grupul 6 Vanatoare: The next day, the 16 IAR-81Cs put in the air were again intercepted before they could attack the bombers, so they disengaged, without suffering any losses. The same thing happened on 28 June.
