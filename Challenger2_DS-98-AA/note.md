Recently got the RFM Chally 2, and love both the boxart and the scheme on it. Was struggling to figure out what unit/deployment that'd be from (RFM don't say, unfortunately), and, if you are scratching your head about the same reason, here's the answer: this is a Chally 2 of the Royal Welsh Battlegroup participating in the Prairie Storm (Lightning) exercise at BATUS (British Army Training Unit Suffield), Alberta, Canada, June 2014. Hi res photo courtesy of Sgt Mark Webster RLC. Why RFM are showing a Royal Scots Dragoons sign (in Germany) is beyond me ðŸ˜ƒ

EDIT (many thanks to Mark Graham and Tim Carson on Facebook/TMM for excellent and well informed comments below): it is very possible the tank really did/does belong to the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (they having been stationed in Germany for a long time, D Squadron), and it was only attached to the Welsh Battlegroup at BATUS in 2014 (since the Royal Welsh don't have tanks, and the Battle group is a composite inter-unit group).
