497th TFS 8th TFW Night Owls
----------------------------

The 497th Tactical Fighter Squadron (TFS) "Night Owls" was a specialized U.S. Air Force unit, primarily flying F-4 Phantoms from Ubon Air Base, Thailand, during the Vietnam War, famous for pioneering night interdiction and Forward Air Control (FAC) missions to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Known for adapting tactics and painting their aircraft black for stealth, they were crucial in night operations using techniques like laser-guided bombs and served as elite "Fast FACs," calling in strikes and attacking targets themselves from dusk to dawn.

Key Aspects:

- Mission: Intercepting enemy supply movements at night (dusk to dawn).
- Aircraft: Primarily F-4C and F-4D Phantoms.
- Nickname: "Night Owls" (also "Hooters").
- Base: Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand (part of the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing, "Wolf Pack").
- Tactics: Developed "Fast FAC" (Forward Air Control) missions, calling in other aircraft and attacking targets themselves.
- Special Markings: F-4s had black undersides for better concealment at night, unique among Phantom units.
- Innovations: Tested early laser-guided bombs (GBU-1 with Pave Knife and Pave Spike targeting pods) during combat evaluations.
