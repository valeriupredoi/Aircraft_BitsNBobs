From [DStorm site](https://dstorm.eu/pages/en/usa/f-4e.html):

Six F-4E from the 3rd TFS/3rd TFW were deployed, but only four made it to Incirlik on 2/20/91. Two others, 71-1075 and ??? were stuck at Spangdahlem AB, Germany.
The unit's AN/AVQ-26 Pave Tack pods were stuck in a transport at Hickam AFB, and did not arrive in time for combat use.
The unit's first combat action occured on 2/22/91, when they flew AAA suppressions missions for F-16's against Al Mosul, Iraq, with similiar combat missions on 2/26 and 2/27.

Ordnance configurations were the same for all combat missions, all aircraft:
- a single CBU-87/D on each of the inboard pylons, the left one suspended from "special weapons" adapter (the special weapons adapter was screwed directly to the inboard pylon where the MAU-12 was usually located. Therefore the pylon did not feature any sway braces anymore.)

- AIM-9 missile rails were in place on the left inboard pylon, but no Sidewinder missiles were carried
- AIM-7F's in the two rear Sparrow wells
- "deep" ALQ-131(V)-14 in left front Sparrow well, right front well unused
- two 370 gallon fuel tanks on outer wing pylons
- 600 gallon fuel tank on centerline

4 missions were flown, the second one resulted in a no drop due to wrongly inserted coordinates in the AN/ARN-101, resulting in the pilot being not 100% sure of the target.
Their wingman did also not drop since they noticed lead to abort the run. The very first mission was flown with 73-1199 as lead, marked as 13th AF flagship and 73-1198 as wingman, the only one of the 4 deployed jets without shark teeth.

A Pave Tack laser designation mission was set for 2/28/91, but was cancelled due to the cease fire. Planes were loaded, but did not fly, with:

- Paveway GBU-10C/B's mounted directly to the each inboard pylon (target was Airbus A300 - there was a ceasefire so no mission was executed)
- AN/AVQ-26 Pave Tack on centerline, replacing 600 gallon tank
- two 370 gallon fuel tanks on outer wing pylons

All aircraft were AN/ARN-101 and TISEO equipped. All planes left Turkey 19/3/91, and went directly to AMARC 25/3/1991 via stops at McGuirre, Robbins a Kirtland AFB.

* Airframe 72-1407 was transferred 06/1991 to Keflavik AFB, Iceland. There it was resprayed as F-4E 66-0300 which was the last F-4E to leave Keflavik at 11/1985.

### Conversations with veterans, on Facebook

- Jason Vorhees (ex WSO in 3 TFS) and Jason Holt (Life Support 3rd TFS) confirm deployment to Incirlik of F-4E's, and their long route: 18,600 miles eastbound to Turkey, and also the fact that they had arrived very late, and only on the day the war ended they were ready for a Pave Tack mission;
